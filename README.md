## Getting Started ðŸ‘‹

scripts:
```bash
npm run dev // start dev server
npm run build //create build 
```
I decided to showcase my skills with both the server and client sides. On the client side, I integrated `SWR`, while on the server side, I'm using the default `fetch API`. I also utilized utility libraries like `tailwind-merge`, `clsx`, and `class-variance-authority` to simplify working with styles. Additionally, I created a `Suspense` component to handle loading states. I hope you find this solution impressive, and I look forward to moving on to the next stage. Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
